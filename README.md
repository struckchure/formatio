# Formatio: Simplifying Cloud DevOps for Developers ‚òÅÔ∏è

Formatio is a robust platform engineered to streamline the entire software deployment lifecycle, bringing the power of cloud-based virtual machines (Formachs) directly to developers. It integrates seamlessly with your existing Git workflows, offering automated CI/CD pipelines, intuitive network management, and comprehensive billing, all wrapped in a modern, user-friendly interface. Our goal is to eliminate DevOps complexities, allowing you to focus purely on building amazing applications.

## Installation

Getting Formatio up and running locally is straightforward. Follow these steps to set up both the backend API and the frontend application.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

*   [Go (1.22.x)](https://golang.org/dl/)
*   [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
*   [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
*   [Node.js (v18+)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
*   [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/)

### üöÄ Clone the Repository

Start by cloning the project repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:struckchure/formatio.git
cd formatio
```

### üì¶ Backend Setup

1.  **Environment Variables**: Create a `.env` file by copying the sample provided:
    ```bash
    cp .env.sample .env
    ```
    Open `.env` and fill in the necessary values. Pay close attention to `PG_`, `APP_PORT`, `JWT_`, `GH_APP_`, `AUTH0_`, `RABBITMQ_URL`, `K8S_CLUSTER_CONFIG`, `INGRESS_ROOT_DOMAIN`, and `REDIS_URL`. For local development, many of these can use default values or be configured to point to your local Docker Compose services. `K8S_CLUSTER_CONFIG` can point to your local `.kube/config` file (already included in the repository).

2.  **Database Migrations**: Formatio uses Prisma for database management. Apply the migrations to set up your database schema:
    ```bash
    go run github.com/steebchen/prisma-client-go migrate deploy
    go run github.com/steebchen/prisma-client-go generate
    ```

3.  **Run Services**: Start the essential backend services (PostgreSQL, RabbitMQ, Redis) using Docker Compose:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

4.  **Install Go Modules**: Ensure all Go dependencies are in place:
    ```bash
    go mod tidy
    ```

5.  **Start the Backend**: You can run the backend in development mode with hot-reloading using `air` (configured via `.air.toml`) or directly:
    ```bash
    # For hot-reloading (recommended for development)
    air

    # Or, for a standard run
    task dev
    ```

### üíª Frontend Setup

1.  **Navigate to Client Directory**:
    ```bash
    cd client
    ```

2.  **Environment Variables**: Create a `.env` file for the frontend:
    ```bash
    cp .env.sample .env
    ```
    Update the `VITE_API_URL` and other relevant `VITE_` variables to match your backend setup.

3.  **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    yarn
    ```

4.  **Generate API Clients**: The frontend uses `kubb` to generate API hooks and types from the backend's Swagger/OpenAPI specification.
    ```bash
    yarn kubb:generate
    ```

5.  **Start the Frontend**:
    ```bash
    yarn dev
    ```

Now, both your backend API and frontend application should be running locally!

## Usage

### üåê Accessing the Application

Once both the backend and frontend are running, you can access the Formatio web interface by navigating to `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser (or the port specified in `client/vite.config.ts`).

### üîë Authentication

*   **Local Registration/Login**: Use the `/register` and `/login` routes to create a new account or sign in with email and password.
*   **Social Login**: Formatio supports social authentication via Google and GitHub, powered by Auth0. Click the respective buttons on the login/registration page to connect your accounts.

### üöÄ Creating and Managing Formachs

1.  **Create a Formach**: Navigate to the "Formachs" section in the dashboard and click "Create Formach." You'll choose a name, a machine image (e.g., Alpine, Ubuntu), and a plan (CPU/memory allocation).
2.  **Monitor Status**: Once created, monitor your Formach's status (creating, running, shutting down) directly from the dashboard.
3.  **Configure Networking**: Under a Formach's "Networking" tab, you can set up port forwarding and generate public hostnames for your deployed applications.
4.  **Connect Repositories**: In the "Repository" tab, link your GitHub repositories to a Formach. This step is crucial for enabling continuous deployments.

### üîÑ Automated Deployments

1.  **GitHub Integration**: Ensure your GitHub account is authorized. If you haven't done so during social login, you can authorize it from the dashboard.
2.  **Define Actions**: Formatio looks for a `.formatio/action.yaml` file in your connected repository. This YAML file defines the build and deployment steps that Formatio will execute on your Formach.
3.  **Push to Deploy**: After connecting a repository and defining your action, every push to the configured branch (e.g., `main` or `master`) will automatically trigger a deployment to your Formach.
4.  **View Logs**: Track the progress and output of your deployments in real-time within the "Deployments" tab of your Formach's details page.

### üìà API Documentation

The backend API is documented using Swagger. Once the backend is running, you can access the interactive API documentation at:

*   `http://localhost:<APP_PORT>/swagger/index.html` (replace `<APP_PORT>` with your configured backend port, typically `8000`).

This interface allows you to explore all available API endpoints, their expected parameters, and response structures.

## Features

*   **‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud VM Provisioning (Formachs)**: Quickly provision and manage cloud-based virtual machines tailored to your application's needs.
*   **üîó Integrated Git/GitHub CI/CD**: Seamlessly connect your GitHub repositories to automate build and deployment pipelines via webhooks.
*   **üö¶ Automated Network Configuration**: Easily configure public access to your applications with automated ingress and port mapping.
*   **üí∏ Billing & Subscription Management**: Track usage and manage payment methods and invoices for your cloud resources.
*   **üîê Flexible User Authentication**: Supports traditional email/password login and modern social authentication (Google, GitHub) via Auth0.
*   **üñ•Ô∏è Real-time Deployment Logs**: Monitor your CI/CD pipeline execution with live streaming logs, providing immediate feedback on deployment status.
*   **üß© Extensible Action Workflow**: Define custom build and deployment steps using intuitive YAML configurations (leveraging Formatio Storm).
*   **‚ú® Modern User Interface**: A clean, intuitive React-based frontend built with Vite, Tailwind CSS, and TanStack Query for an exceptional user experience.
*   **üß™ Robust Testing Framework**: Comprehensive unit and integration tests ensure reliability and maintainability of critical services.
